  <td> <p> The Pyramids of Giza are without a doubt Egypt’s most iconic destination. The Pyramids are a remnant of Ancient Egypt, built almost five thousand years ago, and the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the World. These ancient structures are not only one of the world’s greatest wonders, but one of its biggest mysteries, too: historians still don’t fully understand why Giza’s three Pyramids and Sphinx have been so well preserved throughout the millennia. Inside these grand structures which were created by the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, you’ll marvel at the hieroglyphics that tell the story of life in the ancient world. See the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, the Pyramid of Menkaure, and the Great Sphinx at the Giza Pyramid Complex, which is located just minutes from modern-day Cairo. With daily tours departing from Cairo, Sinai, and other cities around Egypt, you can be sure to experience the wonder of the Pyramids on your Egypt tour.
